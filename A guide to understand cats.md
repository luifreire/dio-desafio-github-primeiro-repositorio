| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| *soft fur*            | *soft fur*         | *soft fur*                |
| *big paws with claws* | tree color pattern | *big paws with claws*     |
| big hunting eyes      | round blue eyes    | little pink noses         |

With this data, we can be sure that *they all have things in common*, and some of their similarities are not shared by each and everyone of them.
